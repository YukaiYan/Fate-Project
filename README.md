## TODO list
First of all, thanks you for your commitment, well done.

This is for reference only, will be updated on a weekly basis

#### 1. The buttons are not disabled when the user didn't select anything
   should return -1 or some special character to indicate the user selects nothing in 15s.
   Be aware that the following code in GoogleSearch.js is not working.
      
    submitButton.disabled = true
    
#### 2. Randomized Algorithms, more returned data
   I like the idea of displaying random querys generated by random algorithms to the user, 
   but you need to return more (currently only rating numbers) to the backend so I know which 
   exact query and which exact algorithm the user rated. 
   
   Note that user responses are recorded in
        
    var userResponse = "";
   which, is a string. You can return a string in certain format for me to parse the data. For example, 
   
    "Algorithm_name query_name rate(#) anotherAlgorithm_name query_name rate(#)..." 
   
   separated by spaces so I can parse the data.
   
#### 3. Record the data somehow, SQL? CSV? TXT?
   could write the algorithm in a separate file, then call the corresponding algorithms in views.py
   
#### 4. Concurrency? Security? 
   problems related to multiple read/write data, software development
