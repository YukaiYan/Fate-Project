## TODO list
First of all, thanks you for your commitment, well done.

This is for reference only, will be updated on a weekly basis

#### 1. Update news
   Now, user responses will be recorded in userResponseData folder. But please be aware of the following:
   * Data will only be recorded after user enters their ID and hits "submission" button at the last page.
   * For security concerns, only valid data (generated by our website) will be recorded
   * Duplicate IDs will not be checked (too expensive)
   * Files are in csv format and can be expensive to move around.
   
   The buttons and input box will also be disabled after the user submits their ID.
   
#### 2. TODO: Online database, publish
   Publish the website and more pilot testing (for examining how data is saved)
   
#### 3. Data race, Concurrency, Security Concerns
   problems related to read/write data, general software development
