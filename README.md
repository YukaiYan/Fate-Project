## TODO list
First of all, thanks you for your commitment, well done.

This is for reference only, will be updated on a weekly basis

#### 1. Update news
   Now, user responses will be recorded in userResponseData folder. But please be aware of the following:
   * Data will only be recorded after user enters their ID and hits "submission" button at the last page.
   * For security concerns, only valid data (generated by our website) will be recorded
   * Duplicate IDs will not be checked (too expensive)
   * Files are in csv format and can be expensive to move around.
    
#### 2. TODO: Randomized Algorithms, random error
   I like the idea of displaying random queries generated by random algorithms to the user, 
   but there is a possibility that same query may appear twice consequently. This might confuse the user
   (even myself a little bit)
   
   Idea for fixing: check previous query
        
    var previousQuery;
    if (Query.equals(previousQuery)) {
        display next_query;
        display current_query;
    } else {
        display current_query;
    }
    previousQuery = current_query;
   
#### 3. TODO: Alert and Close at end.html 
   At the last page, after the user hits "submit" button, the webpage should alert the user 
   "Thank you, we have recorded your responses" then close the window immediately.
   This design will prevent user enters the ID again (which will prevent our program to record duplicate data)
   
#### 4. Data race, Concurrency, Security Concerns
   problems related to read/write data, general software development
