      The purpose of this research is to reduce bias and increase fairness of
      the search engines. We want to analyze usersâ€™ choice and see if bias
      affects their experience.

      The use of technology can present risk(s) as part of this research project.
      Some additional risks are related to a loss of confidentiality, especially

      are no other foreseeable risks to participation in this study.

      you. It is also possible that in the future we may want to use or share study
      information that might identify you. If we do, a review board will decide
